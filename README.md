# SSL Checker (Super Scanner)

A simple Python-based SSL checker and mass IP scanner that utilizes `masscan` to scan a list of IP addresses for open ports, specifically targeting SSL-related ports (default is port 443). This tool is useful for network security professionals, penetration testers, or anyone needing to identify live SSL services in a subnet.

## Warning

Before running the code, please use a VPN to avoid getting blacklisted

## Disclaimer

This tool is intended for **educational and legal purposes only**. The author does not condone or endorse the use of this software for any illegal or unethical activities. Users are solely responsible for ensuring that they comply with all applicable laws and regulations when using this tool. Use of this tool without proper authorization may violate local, state, or international laws.

## Features

- Scans a list of IPs using `masscan`.
- Supports customizable scan rate (number of IPs scanned at once).
- Option to scan specific or all ports.
- Saves the scan results to a specified file.
- Easy-to-use command-line interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites

To use this tool, you need to have the following installed:

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [masscan](https://github.com/robertdavidgraham/masscan) (used for scanning IPs)
  - You can install `masscan` via your package manager or from source.
  - On Ubuntu: `sudo apt install masscan`
  - On macOS: `brew install masscan`

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ssl-checker.git
   cd ssl-checker
   ```

2. **Install dependencies (if any):**
   - This project uses `argparse` which is a standard Python library, so no additional dependencies are required.

3. **Ensure masscan is installed:**
   - On Ubuntu:
     ```bash
     sudo apt install masscan
     ```
   - On macOS:
     ```bash
     brew install masscan
     ```

## Usage

### Command-line Arguments

The following command-line options are available:

- `-i` or `--input`: The file path containing a list of IP addresses to scan (default is `ips.txt`).
- `-o` or `--output`: The file path where the scan results will be saved (default is `masscan_results.txt`).
- `--rate`: The number of IPs to scan at once (default is `10000`).
- `-p` or `--port`: The port number(s) to scan (default is `443` for HTTPS). You can specify multiple ports, separating each port number by commas (ex. 443, 80, 8080)
- `--all-ports`: An option to scan all ports, overriding the `--ports` option

### Example Usage

To scan a list of IPs in `ips.txt` for port 443 (HTTPS):

```bash
python super-scanner.py -i ips.txt -o masscan_results.txt -p 443
```

To scan a list of IPs for port 80, 443, and 8080 and save the results to `scan_results.txt`:

```bash
python super-scanner.py -i ips.txt -o scan_results.txt -p 80,443,8080
```

To scan a list of IPs for all portts and save the results to `scan_results.txt`:

```bash
python super-scanner.py -i ips.txt -o scan_results.txt --all-ports
```

To scan with a custom rate (e.g., 5000 IPs at once):

```bash
python super-scanner.py -i ips.txt -o masscan_results.txt --rate 5000
```

### Create the Required Files

If the input (`ips.txt`) or output (`masscan_results.txt`) files don't exist, they will be automatically created when you run the script.

### Running the Script

Ensure that you're connected to a VPN (if necessary) before running the script, especially if scanning a large range of IPs to avoid being blocked.

```bash
python super-scanner.py
```
